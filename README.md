# <Portfolio>

## Description

This website is my professional portfolio! It was created as a way to demonstrate skills and interests to potential employers. As time goes on, I will update it to display recent, and current projects.

To view, simply navigate to the deployed site(https://github.com/ConScorn/portfolio). You can also clone the entire repository at (https://github.com/ConScorn/portfolio).
